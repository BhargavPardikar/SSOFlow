// This is for notes 

// Default Flow 02 - User and Policy is in same non default group {Positive Test  Case} 
// Points to note:- 
// 1. With origin I can navigate between wordperss and IDP while configuring IDP 
// 2. Why does the written code breaks always ? 
// 3. I'm redirecting to jwt.io not getting authenticated first from WOrdpress, and origin issue and going to jwt.io 
// 4. How to import things perfectly ? Stucked there many times 
// 5. Origin issue, as cant redierct to panthroin
// 6. ReferenceError: wordPressidpSelectors is not defined

// Cause:
// Cypress commands that run inside a cy.origin() block are completely isolated from your main test context.
// This means that any variables, constants, imports, or selectors defined outside the cy.origin() block are not accessible inside it by default.

// The variable wordPressidpSelectors is not accessible inside the cy.origin() block because of Cypress’s origin isolation.
// To fix this, pass the selectors through the args parameter when calling cy.origin().
